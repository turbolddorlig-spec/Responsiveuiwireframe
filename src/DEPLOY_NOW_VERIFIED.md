✅ package.json: CORRECT ("build": "vite build")
✅ vercel.json: CORRECT (explicit configuration)
✅ .gitignore: RECREATED (ignores dist/)

## ⚡ DEPLOY IN 3 STEPS (3 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Push to Git

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Verify Vite + Vercel configuration with recreated .gitignore"
git push
```

**Vercel auto-deploys in 1-2 minutes...**

---

### Step 2: Verify Vercel Root Directory

```
🌐 https://vercel.com/dashboard
→ Your project
→ Settings → General → Root Directory

Must be: ./  (or empty)

If different:
→ Change to: ./
→ Save
```

**Critical:** This must point to repository root where package.json is!

---

### Step 3: Redeploy with Cache Disabled

```
Deployments tab
→ Latest deployment [...] menu
→ "Redeploy"

⚠️ MUST UNCHECK:
   [ ] Use existing Build Cache

→ Redeploy button
```

**Wait 2-3 minutes...**

---

## 🆘 IF IT FAILS

### 2. Check Build Logs
```
Deployments → Latest → Logs
→ Look for "dist/index.html"
```

### 3. Clear Cache
```
Redeploy → [ ] Use existing Build Cache ← UNCHECK!
```
